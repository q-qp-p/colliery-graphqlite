-- Test 39: Issue Regression Tests (Previously Expected Failures)
-- ========================================================================
-- PURPOSE: Tests for issues that were previously failing and are now fixed.
--          These were promoted from 11_issue_repro_expected_failures.sql
--          after the underlying bugs were resolved.
-- COVERS:  Issues #34a, #36, #37, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #49, #50, #51
