# UNWIND after WITH loses list variables — "_prev.X" column missing

## Reproducer

```sql
.load build/graphqlite.dylib
SELECT cypher('CREATE ()-[:T]->()');
SELECT cypher('MATCH p = (n)-[r]->() WITH [n, r, p] AS types UNWIND range(0, size(types) - 1) AS i UNWIND range(0, size(types) - 1) AS j WITH types[i] AS lhs, types[j] AS rhs WHERE i <> j RETURN lhs, rhs');
-- Got: GraphQLiteError: no such column: _prev.types
```

## Affected TCK scenarios (6+)

- `Comparison2 [3]` — types-mixed list with UNWIND/UNWIND
- `ReturnOrderBy4 [1]` — ORDER BY of column introduced in RETURN (`_prev.prows`)
- `Unwind1 [3]` — Unwinding a concatenation of lists (`_prev.first`)
- Others with `_prev.<col>` not-found patterns

## Root cause hypothesis

`transform_unwind.c` wraps the prior query as an inner CTE aliased `_prev`,
then expects each prior variable to be selectable via `_prev.<name>`. The
carry-projection logic at `transform_unwind.c:117-140` enumerates the
prior variables, but appears to skip variables whose value is a list
literal (e.g. `types`) — only certain `transform_var` kinds get included.
When the next WITH/UNWIND tries to reference `types[i]`, the inner select
emits `_prev.types` but the projection didn't carry that column through.

## Fix sketch

In `transform_unwind.c`, inspect the carry-cols builder (`dbuf_appendf(&carry_cols, ", _prev.%s AS %s", ...)`).
Determine which `transform_var` kinds it includes and add any missing
kinds (likely `VAR_KIND_PROJECTED` list-typed scalars). Verify with the
reproducer above.

## Affected files

- `src/backend/transform/transform_unwind.c` (around the `carry_cols`
  builder, line ~117-140)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Reproducer `WITH 5 AS x UNWIND range(0, 2) AS i RETURN x, i` works
- [x] No regression on existing UNWIND-after-WITH scenarios (944/944 unit, functional clean)
- [x] TCK delta: +3 net pass, -6 errors (3422 → 3425, 110 → 104)

## Status Updates

**2026-05-21** — Completed in commit d828ec8.

Root cause was as hypothesized but the carry-projection bug was in the
function-call / subscript / binary-op branch, not the list-literal
branch. When the unwound expression is a function call (e.g. `range()`),
`transform_unwind.c` splices the prior FROM tables directly:
```
FROM _with_0, json_each(<func_sql>)
```
rather than wrapping them as `(SELECT * FROM _with_0) AS _prev`. The
splice is intentional — it keeps outer variable refs in `<func_sql>`
in scope. But the carry-cols snippet was hardcoded to emit `_prev.x AS x`,
which has no matching alias in the spliced FROM.

Fix: build a second carry-cols buffer (`carry_cols_orig`) that uses
each carried variable's original `<table>.<col>` alias, and select
between the two forms based on whether the branch splices or wraps.
The wrapping branches (LIST literal, PROPERTY, IDENTIFIER, PARAMETER)
keep using the `_prev.x` form.

## Discovered

2026-05-21 during the I-0042 follow-up TCK error audit (post +75 TCK
session). Multiple test failures share this single root cause.
