# DELETE + RETURN COUNT always returns 0

**GitHub Issue**: #39
**Priority**: P2 - Medium

## Objective

Fix DELETE + RETURN COUNT to report the actual number of deleted entities instead of always returning 0.

## Bug Description

`MATCH (n:Temp) DETACH DELETE n RETURN COUNT(n) AS deleted_count` returns 0 even though nodes are successfully deleted. The count goes from 3 to 0 in a subsequent query, but the inline RETURN reports 0.

## Root Cause

In `query_dispatch.c` (lines 645-663), `handle_match_delete` first executes the DELETE (which removes the nodes), then re-executes the MATCH+RETURN query against the now-empty graph. COUNT operates on zero rows because the nodes no longer exist.

This is acknowledged in archived task `GQLITE-T-0110` line 107: "deleted entities won't be found by the re-query."

The fix requires capturing the matched row count before deletion and injecting it into the RETURN result.

## Reproduction

```cypher
CREATE (n:Temp {id: '1'})
CREATE (n:Temp {id: '2'})
CREATE (n:Temp {id: '3'})

MATCH (n:Temp) RETURN count(n) AS cnt  -- Returns 3
MATCH (n:Temp) DETACH DELETE n RETURN COUNT(n) AS deleted_count  -- Returns 0 (bug)
MATCH (n:Temp) RETURN count(n) AS cnt  -- Returns 0 (nodes gone)
```

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `DELETE n RETURN COUNT(n)` returns the number of deleted nodes
- [ ] `DETACH DELETE n RETURN COUNT(n)` returns the number of deleted nodes
- [ ] Simple `DELETE` without RETURN still works
- [ ] Repro test passes: `TestIssue39` in `test_issue_repro.py`, test 39b in `11_issue_repro.sql`

## Affected Files

- `src/backend/executor/query_dispatch.c` — `handle_match_delete` needs to capture pre-delete count
- `src/backend/executor/executor_delete.c` — may need to pass count info to result

## Status Updates

### 2026-03-27: Implementation complete

**Change:** `src/backend/executor/query_dispatch.c` — added `synthesize_delete_return()` function that detects when a RETURN clause after DELETE contains only COUNT aggregates, and synthesizes the result directly from `nodes_deleted + relationships_deleted` instead of re-querying the now-empty graph. Sets `data_types` to `SQLITE_INTEGER` so the JSON output renders as a number, not a string.

Falls back to the original re-query path for non-COUNT RETURN clauses.

**Test results:**
- 921/921 C unit tests pass
- `TestIssue39::test_delete_return_count` — PASSES (was returning 0, now returns 3)
- Cypher: `[{"deleted_count":3}]` (correct integer output)
- All 3 existing Python DELETE tests pass
- All 43 functional test files pass
