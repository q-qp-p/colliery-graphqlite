# Audit Documentation for Accuracy Against Implementation

## Objective

Systematically review every documentation file to verify that code examples, API signatures, function names, and described behaviors match the current implementation. Fix any discrepancies found.

## Audit Instructions

For each document, perform the following checks:

### 1. Code Examples
- Copy each code example from the documentation
- Run it against the current implementation (or verify syntax matches actual API)
- Check that output/behavior matches what's described
- Verify import paths and module names are correct

### 2. API Signatures
- Cross-reference documented function/method signatures against source code
- Check parameter names, types, and defaults match
- Verify return types are accurate
- Confirm optional vs required parameters

### 3. Feature Claims
- Verify that described features actually exist
- Check that deprecated features are marked or removed
- Confirm new features added since last doc update are included

### 4. Links and References
- Test internal links to other documentation pages
- Verify external links are not broken
- Check that referenced files/paths exist

### When Issues Are Found
- Fix minor issues (typos, small corrections) immediately
- Document larger discrepancies in the Status Updates section
- Create separate tasks for significant documentation rewrites if needed
