# E11: Match6/Match7 — path direction + bound-node optional match

Parent initiative: [[GQLITE-I-0038]] · Clusters **Match6 + Match7** · Current count: **~31 scenarios**

## Objective

Two related semantic gaps:

1. **Match6 — direction handling**. `MATCH p = (a)-[r]->(b)` and
   `MATCH (a)-[r]-(b)` (undirected) — we over-return when direction
   should constrain. Scenarios [5]–[10]: "Path query should return
   results in written order", "Respecting direction when matching",
   "Handling direction of named paths".

2. **Match7 — OPTIONAL MATCH with bound nodes**. `MATCH (a:A), (b:B)
   OPTIONAL MATCH (a)-[r]->(b) RETURN ...` — we either return too many
   rows ("expected 1 got 4") or fall back to "ambiguous column name"
   on more complex shapes.

Both clusters live in the MATCH transform pipeline and share the
underlying issue of how we materialise pattern endpoints into SQL.

## Reproducer

```sh
sqlite3 :memory: <<'EOF'
.load build/graphqlite

-- Match6 [7]: Respecting direction
CREATE (a:A)-[:R]->(b:B);
SELECT cypher('MATCH (a:A) MATCH (b:B) MATCH p = (a)-[:R]->(b) RETURN p');
-- expect: 1 row
SELECT cypher('MATCH (a:A) MATCH (b:B) MATCH p = (b)-[:R]->(a) RETURN p');
-- expect: 0 rows (no edge B→A)

-- Match7 [3]: OPTIONAL MATCH with two bound nodes
CREATE (:Person {name: 'Alice'}), (:Person {name: 'Bob'});
SELECT cypher('MATCH (a:Person {name: ''Alice''}), (b:Person {name: ''Bob''}) OPTIONAL MATCH (a)-[r:KNOWS]->(b) RETURN a.name, b.name, r');
-- expect: 1 row (a=Alice, b=Bob, r=null)
EOF
```

## Target files

- `src/backend/transform/transform_match.c` — relationship direction
  emission. For directed `->`, only `source→target` should join; for
  undirected `-`, both directions should join (via UNION ALL or an
  OR predicate). Audit the direction-flag handling in
  `transform_relationship_join`.
- `src/backend/transform/transform_match.c` — OPTIONAL MATCH path
  with both endpoints already bound: should be a LEFT JOIN on the
  full predicate, not a fresh MATCH. Currently produces too many
  rows because we re-bind the endpoints from a fresh MATCH.

## Expected delta

`+15` to `+25`.

Scenarios expected to flip:
- `clauses/match/Match6.feature` [5]–[10] (direction + path order)
- `clauses/match/Match7.feature` [3], [4], [8], [9] (optional with
  bound nodes)

## Verification

```sh
angreal build extension
angreal test tck --filter "Match6|Match7" 2>&1 | tail -10
angreal test tck 2>&1 | grep "TCK \[ext"

# Spot-checks per the reproducer above.

# Regression guard
angreal test unit
angreal test functional
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Direction-respecting MATCH returns the right rows (no extra,
      no missing).
- [ ] OPTIONAL MATCH with already-bound endpoints produces exactly
      one row per outer binding (with relationship NULL if no edge).
- [ ] No regressions on currently-passing Match5/Match8 scenarios.

## Risks

- The MATCH transform pipeline is one of the largest files in the
  project. Verify a narrow surgical change (direction flag, or
  endpoint-binding for OPTIONAL) instead of a rewrite.

## Status updates

### 2026-05-18 — blocked / investigation only

**Outcome:** TCK unchanged (3211). No code changes — the failing
Match6/Match7 scenarios decompose into three sub-problems, each of
which needs its own substantial change.

**What the failing scenarios actually require:**

1. **Path "written order" serialization (Match6 [5]/[6]/[9]/[10]/
   [11]/[14]/[16]/[17]/[18]).** Failing as "unmatched expected row"
   because we serialise paths with start→end in numeric node-id
   order, while the TCK expects start→end to mirror the *textual*
   order of the pattern (so `MATCH p = (a)<-[:T]-(b)` returns a
   path whose first node is `a`, not `b`). This is a serialisation
   rewrite in `executor_result.c` / path-formatting — significant
   work, distinct from MATCH transform.

2. **OPTIONAL MATCH with bound endpoints (Match7 [3]/[4]/[8]/[9]).**
   `MATCH (a:A), (b:C) OPTIONAL MATCH (x)-->(b) RETURN x` returns 4
   rows instead of 1 — the optional pattern isn't constraining `x`
   to point at the bound `b`. The transform treats the OPTIONAL
   subpattern as a fresh MATCH and unwinds via cartesian product.
   Fix needs explicit "treat already-bound endpoints as constraints,
   not new bindings".

3. **Path-variable rebinding validation (Match6 [23], ~20 examples).**
   `MATCH p = (p)-[]-()` should SyntaxError: `p` is being bound as
   both a path and a node. Needs path-variable awareness in the
   rebind check; the existing `check_create_rebinds_ex` only sees
   nodes/rels.

4. **Recursive ambiguous-column on path-with-varlen (Match6 [15]/
   [19]/[20], Match7 [13]/[20]).** `SQL prepare failed: ambiguous
   column name: n_2.id` — the named-path + varlen combination emits
   two aliases for the same target node id. Single-line aliasing
   fix in `transform_match.c` but needs careful trace.

5. **`(a)<-->(b)` bidirectional rel (Match6 [12]/[13]).** Grammar
   rejects `<-[:T]->`. Needs a parser rule for the bidirectional
   form.

6. **OPTIONAL with `<-[r]-` reverse using a bound rel-var (Match7
   [4]).** Returns 0 rows instead of 1-with-null because the
   existing-binding constraint on `r` makes the optional pattern
   un-matchable AND swallows the outer row. Fix needs
   `LEFT JOIN ... ON (false_for_reverse) → null`.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Direction-respecting MATCH — not addressed (needs path-serialisation
      rewrite + bidirectional grammar).
- [ ] OPTIONAL MATCH with bound endpoints — not addressed (needs
      transform-side recognition of bound endpoints).
- [x] No regressions (verified by running TCK — count unchanged).

**Recommendation:** split into the six sub-tasks above; each can
attack one specific failure family. Doing them as one task overshoots
budget by ~5x.

**Files touched:** none.
