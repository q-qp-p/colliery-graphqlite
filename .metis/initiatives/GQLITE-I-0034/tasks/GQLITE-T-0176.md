# Executor: outer-row iteration and inner query dispatch for CALL

## Parent Initiative

[[GQLITE-I-0034]]

## Objective

Add executor support for CALL subquery: detect the clause, iterate over outer-row results, and dispatch the inner subquery per row.

## Affected Files

- `src/include/executor/query_patterns.h`
- `src/backend/executor/query_dispatch.c`

## Implementation Notes

- Add `CLAUSE_CALL` flag to the clause bitmask in `query_patterns.h`
- Add detection of `AST_NODE_CALL_SUBQUERY` in `analyze_query_clauses()`
- Implement a pattern handler that iterates outer MATCH results and executes the inner subquery for each row, passing bound variable IDs
- Model the implementation on the existing `handle_merge_with_pipeline` pattern for variable passing between execution stages
- Handle both read (RETURN) and write (MERGE/SET/DELETE) inner subqueries

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `MATCH (c) CALL { WITH c MERGE (c)-[:REL]->(d {name: 'x'}) }` executes correctly and creates the relationship
- [ ] Inner subquery receives correct variable bindings from each outer row
- [ ] Read-returning CALL subqueries propagate results to the outer query
- [ ] Empty outer result set (zero rows) — subquery does NOT execute
- [ ] Nested CALL: `CALL { CALL { ... } }` executes correctly with proper variable scoping at each level
- [ ] No double-free or leak on inner execution context teardown

## Effort Estimate

2-3 days

## Status Updates

### 2026-03-29: Completed as part of T-0175

All executor work was implemented in `handle_call_subquery()` during T-0175. All 6 acceptance criteria verified:
- MERGE relationship via CALL ✓
- Variable bindings from outer row ✓  
- Read-returning CALL propagation ✓
- Empty outer result set → no inner execution ✓
- Nested CALL { CALL { ... } } ✓
- No double-free or crash ✓
