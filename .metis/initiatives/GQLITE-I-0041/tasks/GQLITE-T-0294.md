# C9: Migrate every MERGE variant caller to canonical execute_merge_clause

## Parent Initiative

[[GQLITE-I-0041]]

## Objective

Update every caller of `execute_merge_clause`, `execute_merge_clause_with_vars`, `execute_merge_clause_with_varmap`, `execute_merge_clause_with_vars_ex`, `execute_merge_with_variables` to the canonical signature from C8.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every caller compiles against the canonical signature.
- [ ] The five variant function bodies still exist (deletion happens in C10).
- [ ] TCK delta zero.

## Status Updates

*To be added during implementation*
